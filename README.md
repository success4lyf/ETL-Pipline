## Project Overview
In this project, a fully scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is built to handle large volumes of transaction data for a café business that has many branches. This pipeline will collect all the transaction data generated by each individual café branch and place it in a single location. By being able to easily query the company's data as a whole, the client will drastically increase their ability to identify company-wide trends and insights.
